# HR-data-analysis
Analysing employee data in order to improve organization's workforce performance
This project analyzes HR data to understand the relationship between employee performance and compensation. We explored questions like:
- Are there correlations between marital status and department?
- Visualize the trend of Employee Attrition over the years. 

Tools and Technologies:
- Utilized Excel for data cleaning, calculations, and initial performance vs. compensation visualizations.
- Leveraged Tableau's interactive dashboards to create insightful data visualizations for deeper exploration.
